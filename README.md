# ✍️ Handwritten Math Equation Solver  

A **Neural Network project** that reads handwritten math equations, understands them, and solves them automatically. It uses **Deep Learning** to recognize digits and mathematical symbols, processes the equation, and provides the correct solution — making solving handwritten problems **fast and accurate**.
